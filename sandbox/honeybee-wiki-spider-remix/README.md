# [Honeybee Wiki / Spider Remix Read Me]( #README.md )

## Original document: [Honeybee Wiki]( https://docs.ladybug.tools/honeybee-wiki/ )

## Source code: [github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-wiki]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-wiki)

## [Honeybee Wiki / Spider Remix]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/honeybee-wiki-spider-remix/ )


## Concept

A number of significant apps develop and host their documentation using GitHub Pages or Wiki. These apps include [Bootstrap]( https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#documentation ), [D3]( https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki ), [Three.js]( https://threejs.org/docs/ ) and [React Native]( https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html ). Apart from just following what the big peeps do, there are good reasons for hosting apps and documentation on the same service. The benefit is that users may use the skills they acquire in creating pull requests, responding to issues and creating readme files and so to better advantage on because both the apps and the documentation are based on identical skill sets.

***

It's really nice - but not at all mandatory - when free, open source [FOSS] software is developed and documented with FOSS. The nice thing then is that students and start-ups in less economically developed ares of the world are not penalized for lack of funds or accees.

***

A core premise of the Spider project is that all Spider apps should be readable and understandable by entry level programmers. It makes sense that the apps used to build and display Spider documents follow the same principles.

***

The apps we use here are the mostly the same as the scripts used throughout the Spider network. This little project is a first attempt at building a script for other apps in the Ladybug Tools network.
