# [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer Read Me]( #sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/README.md )


## Concept

* Radiance HDR files converted to PNG files in real-time 3D in your browser using the Three.js JavaScript library

### Features in latest Release

* Obtains the list of PNG files included in a given test case folder on GitHub - uses GitHub API
* Lists the names of the files with links to each file in the menu
* Parses the file name string of the bitmap to obtain
	* Center point, normal, rotation as floating point Three.js vectors
	* width and height of each texture
* Loads each bitmap as a Three.js texture
* Creates a Three.js plane for each bitmap
	* Applies texture to the plane
	* Positions plane at center point
	* Rotates plane to align to the normal
	* Sizes plane according to the specified width and height
* Draws the direction vector as cast from the center of the mesh in black
* Draws the normal as cast from the center of the mesh in cyan
* Main menu allows you to select all eight test cases
* Sub-menu displays list of all files loaded
	* Octocat icon links to source file on GitHub
	* Item link displays just the selected surface

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R6.4]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r6/speed-rad2solar-viewer4.html )

* Add edges to planes except roof and ground
* Fix mesh rotations
* Set material sides to front side only

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R6.3]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r6/speed-rad2solar-viewer3.html )

* Many things working but not all roofs and overhangs

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R6.2]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r6/speed-rad2solar-viewer2.html )

* Fixes diagonal facades in Test Case 3 & 4
* Braeks north and south facades

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R6]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r6/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

* Flips surfaces 180 degrees where normal vector Z is not &#8723;1  Just because.




### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R5]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r5/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

* WIP but getting there

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R5.3 ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r5/speed-rad2solar-viewer.3.html )

* Fixes ground plane but turns south facades to be upside down

#### Issues

* If you load a number of files you may run over the GitHub API usage limits. If so wait an hour and you will be good to go again
	* Confirm this is the issue using JavaScript Console and noting 403 error
	* A future release may allow you to enter a GitHub API key
* Test Cases 3 and 4 include some bogus/broken facades. Not sure where error is
* Test Case 1: shade building has issues

BW-Theo, we are pushing new pngs to folder viewer is pointing at. Make backup of all your original png files. We know what the issue is with all the test cases we thing. You have the u and v vectors off 180 degrees.

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R4]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r4/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

* Reads PNG files instead of HDR files

***

## _None of the earlier demos work because the data files were erased_

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R3]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r3/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

* Obtains the list of RGBE/HDR files included in a given test case folder on GitHub
* Lists the names of the files with links to each file in the menu
* Parses the file name string of the bitmap to obtain center point and and normal as floating point Three.js vectors
* Obtains the width and height of each texture
* Loads each bitmap as a Three.js texture
* Creates a Three.js plane for each bitmap
	* Applies texture to the plane
	* Positions plane at center point
	* Rotates plane to align to the normal
	* Sizes plane according to the specified width and height
* Displays a tellTale at center of Mesh
* Displays a tellTale  at end of dirction vector
* Draws the direction vector as cast from the center of the mesh in black
* Draws the normal as cast from the center of the mesh in cyan

#### Issues

* Out of 14 test files only nine are loaded successfully
	* Whether errors are because of HDR source issues or because of Three.js RGBELoader issues is not ye known
	* Investigation by modifying Three.js RGBELoader source code is the next action item
* Rotations not fully worked

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R2]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r2/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

#### Currently broken as BMP source files were deleted
* Obtains the list of bitmaps included in a given folder on GitHub
* Lists the names of the bitmaps with links of each file in the menu
* Parses the file name string of the bitmap to obtain center point and and normal as floating point Three.js vectors
* Loads each bitmap as a Three.js texture
* Creates a Three.js plane for each bitmap
	* Applies texture to the plane
	* Positions plane at center point
	* Rotates plane to align to the normal
	* Sizes plane according to width and height proportions of the bitmap

#### Issues

* Some planes are rotated incorrectly by 90 degrees
* Future bitmaps will have suitable sizing data

### [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer R1]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/r1/speed-rad2solar-viewer.html )

####  Currently broken as BMP source files were deleted
* Forked from [Rad Viewer Bitmap R3.1 Speed]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/rad-viewer/rad-viewer-bitmap/r3-speed/rad-viewer-bitmap.html )
