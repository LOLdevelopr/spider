# Firm, Commodious and Delightful


The whole thing of computer-aided drafting and design is getting quite old and drafty. Much older than other modern ways of doing things.

If I want to go somewhere, I enter an address on my phone and some service or another gets me there. If I want a tasty meal, I ask for recipes. The computer helps me find one I like and then it shows me how to make it. If I want nice clothes, there are so many options to choose from. I can get clothes made for me. I can get clothes second-hand. There are many tools to help me/

But if I want a new house, it means somebody has to sit down and draw arcs, lines and circles. If I don't like what they do so we start over again. Rinse and repeat. This is a drastic oversimplification, but :

There has to be a better way.

Actually the better way was probably written down a few thousand years ago in what is now known as first book of Genesis: And god said let there be light and there was light. And god said let there be a firmament and there was firmament.

The dude didn't sit down and draw something, he just thought about it and it appeared. Coming back to my new house, do you really want me to fuss about window positions and door sizes in this era?

What I really want to do is something like this. I need a house with 4 bedrooms and 3 baths. It needs space for my drum kit, bicycles for all of us and our stamp collection. We have two teenage children, and our parents come to visit quite frequently. We have a cat and a canary. The land is sloping on three quarters of an acre. We want to spend $325,000. And so on.

My phone thinks a bit and then starts projecting images on the wall. It runs through about half a dozen designs telling me the features of each. After each one it asked me what I like and don't like about the designs. After the first pass, it comes back with three more refined designs. We talk some more and decide on a final design.

The next day the robot start pouring the 3D building printing admixture on site. It's ready for us to move in in 3 weeks. Over the next three years we make some significant changes at about six months intervals. With each new iteration, the program and robots take care of the myriad of details. These might include sizing and position windows so as to keep energy consumption down and yet offer views of the nice terrain around. (This is because you can read the data from Google Earth.)

Of course all the details such as insulation, u-values, being LEED-certified, having good drainage and sufficient hot water, protection from insects and other vermin, minimizing the need for snow shovels and air conditioning, ease of washing and cleaning the house, and complying with all local state and federal regulations along with insurance and mortgage requirements. All in an architectural gem worthy of being featured in an architectural digest issue. The objectives, the design and the robots are always in sync.

The design your home programs we have today are sweet, but they are not the future. With artificial intelligence and all the computer horsepower be coming available, we must leave behind pencil and paper thinking. We must disrupt our most homie behaviors.

We're not there yet, we are not even nearly there yet.

We need online access to many thousands of building designs. We need online access to the mini codes laws and regulations that's around the built environment. We need better access to online engineering and climate data.

As the corpora builds and enlarges, we can start to ask the artificial intelligence peeps to have a look at the data.

Architects and engineers will growing into entirely new professions. Instead of dealing with codes and construction problems, they will be really working on making buildings  - as the Roman architect Vitruvius wanted - firm, commodious and delightful.
